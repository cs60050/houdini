## Reinforcement Learning Agents for Playing Flappy Bird

### Requirements:
* **pygame-learning-environment** (http://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* **graphviz** for rendering the learnt network in NEAT

### Agents implemented:
1. Tabular Q Learning: Standard textbook algorithm. Best performance at the moment
2. NEAT: Genetic Algorithm that learns a neural network mapping agent inputs to actions
3. Deep Q Learning: In development
