# CartPole-v0 Experiment using NEAT Algorithm

## Running Locally

### Dependencies

1. Python NEAT library

 `pip install neat-python`

 For more information visit this link: http://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html 

2. OpenAI Gym Environment

### Execution

1. cartPole-v0_configuration 
	
This file contains the important hyperparameters required for NEAT. The file can be modified as a regular text file.

2. Execute the file by typing the following command in the working directory.

`python cartpole-neat.py'


## Working

The algorithm is a genetic algorithm which aims to approximate a target function by mimicking human evolution. More information can be found in the paper whose link is given below.
